## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [react-burger-menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-burger-menu) - Library to facilitate burger menus

### What I learned

Better understanding about grids with Tailwind

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```jsx
<main className="flex flex-col md:grid grid-cols-1 grid-rows-8 md:grid-cols-3 gap-5  w-full h-fit">
  <div className="order-1 w-full h-[300px] md:row-span-2 col-span-1 md:col-span-2 bg-img-top-mob md:bg-img-top-dsk bg-cover bg-no-repeat"></div>
```

### Continued development

Each opportunity the deal with Tailwind new details emerge...

## Useful resources

- [Burger Menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-burger-menu) - Tool to facilitate creation of burger-menus.

## Acknowledgments

I did this challenge several weeks ago but was too ashamed of the code to post it...
Now after several projects I'm less ashamed.
